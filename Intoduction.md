## INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEM

An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling efficient resource management and user interaction.

Operating systems are essential for the functioning of computers and other devices, as they handle tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, file management, and device control. They provide a user interface, allowing users to interact with the system through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or command-line interfaces (CLIs).
